# bubble-sort

So, let's sort integer array by bubble algorithm.
Program searching for input in the separate lines:
1-Line) Size of array = N;
2-Line) First array member;
...
Last-line) Last array member;

When you will try to compile this program with GNU gcc
compiler from comand line you should also enter code:
"-std=c++11"
because option:
    int *p = new int[100];
will appear only from c++ 11 version.

Report me, please, about bugs, if find any.

Good luck!
